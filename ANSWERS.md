- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
      We would use class components to have access to React.Component base class that will allow us to have methods that will help us to use Component Lifecycle.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
      ComponentDidMount - This sets up initial data. Its invoked immediately after a component is mounted. - set up subscriptions
      ComponentDidUpdate - invoked immediately after an update occurs - if props change, make an update.
      ComponentWillUnMount - Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted. This is a clean up method . E.g cancel network requests

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      Custom hooks allow us the ability to have reusable hooks throughout our application

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      To save time, money and reduce bugs in our code. To also be confident that our code works as expected.
